Megan Hoover

Hi, I'm Megan; a Michigan native. I'm currently in the Ecosystem Science & Sustainability program at Colorado State University, and I'm working on a Watershed Science minor as well. I've got skills in data analysis, hydrology, and project management. I love learning new skills related to my field and teaching them to the community. In my free time I like to go on adventures, craft, cook, or spend time with my husband and two dogs. Check out my site!
