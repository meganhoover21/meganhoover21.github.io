Megan Hoover

Hi, I'm Megan; a Michigan native. I'm currently a junior in the Ecosystem Science & Sustainability program, and working on a Watershed Science minor at Colorado State University. Professionally, I love learning new skills related to my field and teaching them to the local community. In my free time I like to go on adventures, do some crafty projects, cook, or spend time with my husband and two dogs. Check out my site!
